        Software Development Life Cycle:
        Planning - Taking input from people and using them to identify problems and create solutions.
        Design - Software developers create a design plan. Stakeholders review it and offer feedback. The design outlines how the software functions and technologies used.
        Testing - Software is tested for bugs and meeting requirements.
        Deployment - Software is launched to the production environment and able to be used by end-users.
        Maintenance - While testing eliminates lots of errors, there are usually problems that slip by. Users can submit bug reports.
        
        Since it is a cycle, the steps will keep on repeating after the software is launched.
